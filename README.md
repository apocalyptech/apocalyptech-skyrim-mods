Apocalyptech's Skyrim Mods
==========================

I'm not actually intending to do much modding for Skyrim.  Just about
anything I'd want to do basically already exists.  There were a couple
of things that I wanted, though, and so I've stuck my toe in slightly.

- [Book Sorting SSE (Skypatcher)](Book_Sorting_SSE_SkyPatcher/).  A
  [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)
  mod to, among some other normalizations, move any article prefix
  (the/a/an) from the front of book titles to the end, so that they
  alphabetize properly in inventory and on bookshelves.
- [Potion Sorting SSE (Skypatcher)](Potion_Sorting_SSE_SkyPatcher/).  A
  [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)
  mod to change potion names to include the actuall effect data, and
  allow them to sort more usefully in inventory (all healing potions together,
  all archery potions together, etc).  Only affects vanilla-game "standard"
  potions, not player-created potions!
- [Fix USSEP Book Bounds (SkyPatcher)](Fix_USSEP_Book_Bounds/).
  A SkyPatcher mod to fix some object bounding issues introduced by
  USSEP, which was causing some problems with the
  [Unlimited Bookshelves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2885)
  mod.  It looks like USSEP is likely to fix those bounds in its
  next version, so this little thing probably has a pretty short
  shelf life.

That's it!
