Apocalyptech's Skyrim Mods
==========================

I'm not actually intending to do much modding for Skyrim.  Just about
anything I'd want to do basically already exists.  There were a couple
of things that I wanted, though, and so I've stuck my toe in slightly.

1. [Book Sorting SSE (Skypatcher)](Book_Sorting_SSE_SkyPatcher/).  A
   [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)
   mod to, among some other normalizations, move any article prefix
   (the/a/an) from the front of book titles to the end, so that they
   alphabetize properly in inventory and on bookshelves.
2. [Fix USSEP Book Bounds (SkyPatcher)](Fix_USSEP_Book_Bounds/).
   A SkyPatcher mod to fix some object bounding issues introduced by
   USSEP, which was causing some problems with the
   [Unlimited Bookshelves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2885)
   mod.  It looks like USSEP is likely to fix those bounds in its
   next version, so this little thing probably has a pretty short
   shelf life.

That's it!
