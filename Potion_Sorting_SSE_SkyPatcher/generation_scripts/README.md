Potion Sorting SSE (SkyPatcher) Generation Script
=================================================

This mod is basically entirely generated by an
[xEdit/SSEEdit](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit) script which
is included here.

Preparation
===========

I've generated this mod with the [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition
Patch (USSEP)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)
installed.  Generating the mod without USSEP installed will lead to
slight differences.  (If you run it with other mods which alter the
vanilla game potions/poisons, it should pick up those changes.)

Generation
==========

1. Copy `Generate_SkyPatcher_Potion_Name_Statements.pas` into your SSEEdit `Edit
   Scripts` directory
2. Launch SSEEdit
3. Right click on `Skyrim.esm` and run that script against it.
   That'll generate a bunch of output on the SSEEdit console and also copy it
   to your clipboard.  Paste it into a file (I used `Potion_Sorting_SSE_SkyPatcher.ini`).
4. Right click on `Dragonborn.esm` and do the same.

That's basically it!  I added a few comments to the top of the file, but
that otherwise does the trick.
